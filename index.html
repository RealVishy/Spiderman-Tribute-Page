  Rise of the Spider: The Origin Story of Spider-Man</h3>
    <p>
      Peter Parker was just a normal high school student until he was bitten by a radioactive spider. This bite gave him incredible powers, including the ability to shoot webs and stick to walls. He decides to use his powers for good and becomes Spider-Man, a superhero who protects the city of New York from all sorts of dangerous criminals and villains. Tragically, Peter's Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, which drives Peter to embrace the famous Spider-Man mantra, "With great power comes great responsibility." From then on, Peter dedicates himself to protecting others, even when it means putting himself in harm's way. Despite the challenges he faces, Peter remains determined to be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and be there for his city whenever it needs him.
